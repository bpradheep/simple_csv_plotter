# Sample Data Files for CSV Plotter

This directory contains sample CSV files to help you explore the features of the CSV Plotter application.

## Available Samples

### 1. time_series_data.csv

Weather data tracked over time, perfect for showcasing:

- Line charts to show trends over time
- Multiple Y-axes for different units (temperature, pressure, etc.)
- Automatic timestamp formatting

### 2. comparison_data.csv

Sales data across different categories, ideal for:

- Bar charts for comparing values across categories
- Radar charts to show performance across multiple metrics
- Line charts to display growth over time

### 3. distribution_data.csv

Budget/expense breakdown, excellent for:

- Pie charts to show proportions of a whole
- Doughnut charts for a more modern look
- PolarArea charts to emphasize specific segments while maintaining proportion

### 4. correlation_data.csv

Health metrics data, designed for:

- Scatter plots to identify correlations between variables
- Bubble charts to visualize three dimensions (x, y, and bubble size)
- Line charts to track trends across different metrics

### 5. application_metrics.csv

Performance data for different applications, featuring:

- Application name filtering capabilities
- Time series data for multiple applications
- Various metrics to compare across applications

## Usage Tips

1. **For Time Series Data**:

   - Choose "timestamp" as your X-axis
   - Select multiple metrics as Y-axis columns
   - Try line charts for continuous data and scatter for discrete points

2. **For Comparison Data**:

   - Use "category" as your X-axis
   - Select different metrics for comparison
   - Try bar charts for simple comparisons or radar charts for multidimensional analysis

3. **For Distribution Data**:

   - Use "expense_category" as your X-axis
   - Select "percentage" or "amount" as your Y-axis
   - Try pie, doughnut, or polarArea chart types

4. **For Correlation Data**:

   - Choose a variable like "age" for your X-axis
   - Select other metrics to find correlations
   - Use scatter or bubble charts to visualize relationships

5. **For Application Metrics**:
   - Utilize the application filter dropdown to focus on specific applications
   - Compare performance metrics across time or applications
   - Use different chart types to highlight different aspects of the data

## Chart Type Recommendations

- **Line**: Best for time series and continuous data
- **Bar**: Ideal for comparing values across categories
- **Scatter**: Perfect for showing relationships between variables
- **Bubble**: Use when you have three dimensions of data to display
- **Radar**: Great for comparing multiple variables across categories
- **PolarArea**: Similar to pie but with equal angles and varying radii
- **Doughnut/Pie**: Best for showing proportions of a whole
